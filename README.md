## Description
### Red vs Blue is what is usually used when two opposing teams are played against each other. Used Trebuchet MS font mostly using Bold Text for when a selection is made from the drop down menu and the buttons at the bottom. Regular trebuchet font for the drop down menus while also bolding the selection for that drop down menu. The reasons the buttons are black by the way are cause I couldn't think of a good color for them. maybe cyan blue to represent team liquid.
  ### Update: Updated the mock-up to reflect the new ideas
